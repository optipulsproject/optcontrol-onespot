## Cloning
* Clone this repository using either
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules %(SSH_URL_TO_REPO)s 
  ```
  if you have placed an SSH key in https://gitlab.hrz.tu-chemnitz.de/profile/keys (the preferred method), or else
  ```bash
  git clone --recurse-submodules %(HTTP_URL_TO_REPO)s 
  ```
* Then run 
  ```bash
  bin/numapde-submodules-updates.sh
  ```
  to update the submodules numapde-public/numapde-latex> and numapde-public/numapde-bibliography>.

## Daily workflow
* Run 
  ```bash
  bin/numapde-submodules-updates.sh
  ```
  regularly to update the submodules.
* Run
  ```bash
  bin/numapde-pack-it-all.sh --help
  ```
  to learn about the script and its options which will pack the main `.tex` file and its depenencies into a `.zip` file, e.g., for submission to https://arxiv.org.
* Run
  ```bash
  bin/numapde-setup-paths.sh
  ```
  to setup the `TEXINPUTS` and `BIBINPUTS` environment variables, as necessary.
  It is safe to run this script multiple times since paths will be amended only if necessary.
